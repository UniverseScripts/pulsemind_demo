/**
 * Spreading crowded labels along a shared axis.
 *
 * A bed label is a fixed ~78px wide; the axis it sits on is fluid. When two
 * patients score close together their labels overlap, and the previous approach
 * — stack into one of three rows, decide by a fixed distance in SCORE space —
 * failed twice over: the row counter saturated and wrote surplus labels on top
 * of each other without checking, and the score-space threshold was worth 116px
 * at one viewport and 48px at another.
 *
 * This works in pixels, and moves labels sideways rather than upwards. Every
 * label keeps its full text; the leader line is what ties it back to its mark.

/**
 * CSS pixels in one rem, read from the document rather than assumed to be 16.
 *
 * The gutter sits beside text sized by the type scale, and the type scale is in
 * rem. Hardcoded at 12 it was right at a 16px root and silently wrong the moment
 * `html { font-size }` moved.
 *
 * ⚠️ READ LAZILY, ON FIRST USE — NOT AT MODULE LOAD. Read at load it came back
 * 16 even though the root is 18: in Vite dev the stylesheet is injected by JS
 * after the modules evaluate, so the document has no styles yet when this file
 * runs. `placeLabels` is only ever called during a render, by which point it
 * does. The `document === undefined` fallback keeps the function usable outside
 * a browser, which is what lets the geometry be fuzzed.

/**
 * Place every label. `labelWidth` and `trackWidth` are measured, not assumed —

 * paint draws no labels rather than drawing them all at zero.
 *
 * ONE placement pass over every label, in score order, with rows assigned round
 * robin afterwards. Placing each row separately looked reasonable and was not:
 * two rows centred on their own members drift independently, so a label could
 * end up left of one whose mark is further left. A crossed leader is worse than
 * a crowded one — it points at the wrong patient.
 *
 * ⚠️ GLOBAL PLACEMENT IS NOT ON ITS OWN ENOUGH, and this file claimed for a
 * while that it was. Monotonic `placedX` makes the label ENDPOINTS ordered; it
 * says nothing about the SEGMENTS between mark and label. With the leader drawn
 * straight to a per-row height, `row = index % rows` cycles the rise 22, 42, 62,
 * 22 … so two adjacent labels get very different slopes and the lines cross
 * between the axis and the text — measured on 29% of 200,000 clustered
 * configurations, while the evenly-spread demo ward never showed it.
 *
 * The invariant that actually holds: with `trueX` and `placedX` both
 * non-decreasing and EVERY leader rising the same height R, the gap between two
 * leaders is linear in y and non-negative at both ends (`trueX` order at y=0,
 * `placedX` order at y=R), so it cannot change sign in between. `WardScale`
 * therefore fans every leader to one height and stacks rows on a vertical riser
 * above it — verticals sit at distinct `placedX` and live entirely above the
 * diagonals, so neither can meet the other. Rows are free again.
