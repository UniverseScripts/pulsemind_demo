/**
 * The patient's ventilation, as motion.
 *
 * Period comes from the charted respiratory rate, amplitude from the band, and
 * that split is the safety argument. IEC 60601-1-8 specifies alarm indicators by
 * flash frequency (1.4-2.8 Hz high, 0.4-0.8 Hz medium), so frequency is the
 * channel that carries alarm priority -- here it is set by physiology and never
 * by severity. Amplitude, which the standard is silent on, carries the band.
 *
 * Four properties it must not ship without:
 *
 *   - Never auto-starts: six breaths on a press, so WCAG 2.2.2 never attaches
 *     and no pause control is needed. A pause control would read as an alarm.
 *   - Bounded fill in a fixed track, never a growing glyph.
 *   - Continuous, 100% duty. A flashing indicator is a 20-60% duty square wave.
 *   - Achromatic, beside the numeral rather than replacing it.
 *
 * A reduced-motion preference freezes it on the first frame, which is why the
 * resting frame is drawn as a legible flat trace.
