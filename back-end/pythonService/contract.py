"""Map the internal record onto the frontend data contract.

The clinical shape in, the display shape of `contract/clinical.ts` out. When the
finalised UI lands, this file changes and nothing behind it does.

Three mappings do real work rather than renaming a key:

  share_of_decision   |contribution| / attribution_total, over ALL 109 features.
      The top-8 hold about 77%, so a share over them overstates every one.

  assessment_status   the sufficiency floor decides this, not the model. Either
      share above 0.30 means no score, no band and no prompt -- shaped
      differently so a refusal can never read as a low score.

  source              the dictionary is normative: `population_reference`.
