#: Free VRAM the 7B needs, from the driver, before the load is allowed to start.
#:
#: MEASURED, 2026-09-07. This was a bracket for three weeks -- a segfault at
#: 6561 MiB free and a success at 6721, with 6700 chosen inside the band and the
#: comment admitting it was "slightly optimistic". Nobody had watched the card
#: DURING a load, so the peak was inferred from whether the process survived.
#:
#: `bki/pipeline/tools/vram_probe.py` samples the driver at 5 Hz across the load
#: -- same source, same unit as the check below. Three consecutive loads:
#:
#:   run   free before   PEAK    resident   load    generate
#:     1          6795   6059        5929   16.7s      14.4s
#:     2          7501   6239        6109   17.4s      13.2s
#:     3          7423   6171        6041   15.8s      13.3s
#:
#: Peak max 6239, spread 180. The transient above resident is 130 MiB in ALL
#: THREE runs, which is the steadiest figure in this whole investigation.
#:
#: 6420 = 6239 + 180. Peak plus the observed run-to-run spread, which is the
#: margin that matters: free VRAM at check time is not free VRAM 17 s later, and
#: drift is what made 6561 crash one day and load the next.
#:
#: ⚠️ THIS IS THE "LOWEST THAT LOADS" SETTING, chosen deliberately (2026-09-07)
#: over a safer one. It is BELOW the 6561 that crashed, so it will permit a
#: configuration that has failed before. That is the accepted trade: the failure
#: mode is a segfault that takes the service down, and the mitigation is that a
#: demo should warm the explainer FIRST, when a crash costs a restart rather than
#: an audience. Raise it on any load that fails above this line -- that failure
#: is still the only evidence that narrows the requirement from below.
#:
#: ⚠️ The peak does NOT move with `PM_LLM_EMBED_DEVICE`, so do not lower this
#: constant when that setting changes: the table is on the card while
#: `from_pretrained` runs, whatever happens to it afterwards. What it does change
#: is the room left AFTER the load, and therefore generation speed -- 13.6 s
#: against 21.7 s, measured. See `LLM_EMBED_DEVICE` in `pipeline/config.py`.
#:
#: The VALUE is defined in `pipeline.config`, so this service and the pipeline
#: stage cannot drift apart -- they did, by 1175 MiB, for three weeks. The
#: evidence stays here, where the gate that acts on it lives.
